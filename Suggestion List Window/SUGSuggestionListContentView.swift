    /*
        This view contains the list of selections.  It should be exposed to accessibility, and
        should report itself with the role 'AXList'.  Because this is an NSView subclass, most
        of the basic accessibility behavior (accessibility parent, children, size, position,
        window, and more) is inherited from NSView.  Note that even the role description attribute
        will update accordingly and its behavior does not need to be overridden.  However, since
        the role AXList has a number of additional required attributes, we need to declare them
        and implement them.
